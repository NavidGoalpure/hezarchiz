This project was created as a side project for more developers to use this blog theme. The theme is inspired from the [Jekyll theme of Fresh](https://github.com/artemsheludko/fresh). It has been modified as per need and for better features and integrated to Gatsby.

The support for pagination is intentionally removed as I believe that pagination discourages readers to explore more posts. The code is however there, and developers if wish can add it.

The date is shown on each page for the reader to know the last date of modification of that particular page.
